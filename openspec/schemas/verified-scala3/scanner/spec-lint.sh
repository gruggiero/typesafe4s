# spec-lint.sh — mechanical pre-pass for the spec-lint artifact.
#
# Enforces the greppable subset of the schema's lint checks so that "lint
# clean" is objective and CI-enforceable (same philosophy as
# registry-check.sh). The judgment checks (observability, testability,
# type-feasibility, altitude COMPLIANCE) remain in the spec-lint artifact
# instruction — this script does not replace them.
#
# It DOES, however, decide every judgment check's APPLICABILITY. A conditional
# rule has two halves: "does this rule apply here?" (a repository fact) and
# "does this spec obey it?" (judgment). Only the second is a judgment call.
# The CONTEXT block below is printed unconditionally and states the first half
# as machine-attested fact, including the negative case — because "N/A"
# inferred from an assumption is how a real review once skipped the altitude
# rule entirely, having never looked for openspec/concepts/.
#
# FAIL (exit 1) checks:
#   F1  every "### Requirement:" block contains SHALL or MUST before its
#       first **Given** clause (openspec validate --strict also rejects this)
#   F2  every requirement containing "only", "never", or "must not" has at
#       least one "#### Scenario:" (the ADVERSARIAL rule's mechanical half —
#       whether a scenario's input is actually forbidden stays human-checked)
#   F3  every "### Property:" block declares a "**Generator strategy**" line
#   F4  a spec with requirements has a "## Proof Obligations" section
#   F5  every "### Temporal:" block has "**Trigger event**" and
#       "**Response event**" lines
#   F6  every Proof-Obligations Source names a resolvable reference
#   F7  every requirement is named by >= 1 obligation (reachability)
#   F8  every TYPED source (Property:/Scenario:) names a heading that
#       EXISTS in the spec — a typo used to resolve to nothing
#   F9  (--artifacts only) every code-shaped Artifact token resolves to a
#       tracked file. OFF by default: specs are written BEFORE their tests
#       exist, so the artifact column is a commitment at planning time and a
#       fact only after implementation. Run with --artifacts at apply Step 12.
#   F10 when a behavioural registry EXISTS (openspec/concepts/), a spec with
#       requirements has a "## Concepts Used (behavioral)" section — the
#       structural half of the ALTITUDE rule. Applicability is a fact, so
#       this half needs no judgment; whether the cited concepts are the RIGHT
#       ones, and whether clause prose stays behavioural, still does.
#
# WARN (reported, exit unaffected):
#   W6  a spec declaring Ring 6 Formal Contracts with no obligation naming a
#       BRIDGE/mirror artifact — a proof about a model nobody runs says
#       nothing about the shipped system (see templates/verified-mirror.md)
#   W7  altitude candidates: a code identifier inside a Given/When/Then
#       clause. Four deterministic shapes only — build command, source file,
#       fully-qualified name, and a token that the project's own ledgers
#       classify as code (present in openspec/concept-inventory.md, absent
#       from the behavioural registry). Reported, never failed: a domain term
#       may share a type name, and that call is the reviewer's.
#   W1  vague words (valid/fast/reasonable/correct/appropriate) inside
#       requirement blocks — confirm a concrete definition sits next to them
#   W2  Proof Obligations data rows fewer than requirement count
#   W3  requirements matched by F2 — listed so the human can confirm the
#       scenario input is genuinely forbidden, not just present
#   W8  a concept cited in "## Concepts Used (behavioral)" is named nowhere
#       else in the spec — the citation is never cashed in. WEAK: when a
#       requirement's obligation is the concept's action, the SHALL
#       statement should name it Concept/action; "the system" is the right
#       actor only for behaviour no single concept owns
#
# Usage: spec-lint.sh [--artifacts] [--context-only] [change-dir | repo-root]
#   change-dir:     lint that change's specs/**/spec.md
#   repo-root:      lint every active change (openspec/changes/*, archive excluded)
#   --artifacts:    also run F9 (post-implementation; see above)
#   --context-only: print the CONTEXT block and exit 0, linting nothing. This is
#                   the single source of the applicability facts — hooks/gate.sh
#                   consumes it rather than recomputing them, so a session-start
#                   injection and a lint run can never disagree.

# ── instruction drift ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The question is whether the instructions an agent is following are the ones
# this schema ships. Two earlier attempts got it wrong in opposite ways:
#
#  1. The "generatedBy: verified-scala3-schema/<N>" stamp sat frozen at 7.0.0
#     while the schema reached 11 and nothing read it — drift went unnoticed.
#  2. Reading the stamp then produced FALSE POSITIVES, because the counter is
#     not a single sequence. This schema's header says it "ports the high-yield
#     parts of the adk4s v13 workflow" under its own counter (v5), and adk4s
#     skills carry the SAME stamp prefix with counters 7/11/13. Comparing the
#     two numbers reported drift between files that were byte-identical.
#
# So the stamp is not the evidence: CONTENT is. A skill either matches the
# source this schema ships or it does not, and a diff says so without needing
# the two lineages to agree on a numbering.
#
# Roots are PROJECT-LOCAL only: every harness skills directory under the repo
# root that an agent may read (.claude, .devin, .agents, .pi). install-skills.sh
# installs to all of them that exist. A user-global directory may belong to
# another harness or another project on a different schema version;
# attributing its contents to this schema is the category error that
# produced (2).
#
# EVERY skill this schema ships is compared in EVERY existing root — not a
# single canary. A canary catches a root that was never updated, but not a
# partial install or a hand edit; observed drift was in
# .devin/skills/openspec-next-spec (schema v1 served beside .claude's v5).
