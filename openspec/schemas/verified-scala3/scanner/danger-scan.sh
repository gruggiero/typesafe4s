# danger-scan.sh — report dangerous correctness patterns in a spec's diff.
#
# Ring 1's dangerous-pattern scan, made mechanical: "clean" is this script
# exiting 0, not memory. Scans the PRODUCTION files changed since the given
# baseline (git diff <baseline> --name-only, src/main only) plus any files
# passed via --also (e.g. importers of a widened public type, per the apply
# phase's Step 0 PUBLIC-TYPE-CHANGE IMPACT SCAN).
#
# Every reported line must be REMOVED or JUSTIFIED. A justified line carries
# a same-line comment:   // danger-scan:allow <reason>
# and is then excluded from the report.
#
# Patterns (candidates — some hits are legitimate; that is what the allow
# comment is for):
#   unsafe-get        .get on Option/Either/Try (not .get(...) map lookups)
#   unsafe-head       .head / .tail / .last on collections
#   catch-all         case _ => / case other => / case _: T =>
#   cast              asInstanceOf / @unchecked
#   blocking          Await. / Thread.sleep
#   swallowed         NonFatal (verify the error is not discarded)
#   unreachable-claim "unreachable" / "cannot happen" / "should never"
#   lint-off          scalafix:off
#
# Usage: danger-scan.sh [baseline-ref] [--also file ...]
#   baseline-ref defaults to HEAD (uncommitted work in progress).
# Exit: 0 = no unjustified hits; 1 = hits reported.
