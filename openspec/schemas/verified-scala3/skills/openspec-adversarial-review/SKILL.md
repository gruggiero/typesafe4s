  Ring 8 — adversarial spec-compliance review. After the test oracle passes
  (Ring 2), compare every requirement against the implementation diff
  looking for ways the code could satisfy the tests while violating the
  English spec: silent fallback mappings, case _ defaults, partial functions,
  invalid states constructible through public APIs, violating private
  helpers. Runs in a FRESH CONTEXT (no implementation conversation), BEFORE
  the expensive rings (3 mutation, 4 formal, 5 parity). Produces a
  requirement-by-requirement
  PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL compliance report. Mandatory before every checkpoint.

# Adversarial Spec-Compliance Review Skill (Ring 8)

## Purpose

A passing test suite is NOT proof of spec compliance. Real example from this
workflow's history (`add-eligibility-in-between-operators`): all tests
passed, yet `cmpOpToOrderOp` silently mapped invalid operators to
`OrderOp.Lte`, `cmpOpToCountOp` mapped `IN`/`BETWEEN` to `CountOp.Gte`, and
directly constructing `Expr.Count(..., CmpOp.IN, ...)` silently produced
wrong behavior. This ring hunts for exactly that class of bug.

Review the code as an adversary: assume the implementation is trying to pass
the tests while violating the spec, and try to prove it.

## When to Use

- Step 8 of the apply phase — MANDATORY for every code-changing spec, after
  Ring 2 (property tests), BEFORE Ring 3 (mutation), Ring 4 (formal) and
  Ring 5 (cross-backend parity). This ordering is deliberate: the review is
  cheap, frequently changes code and adds tests, and mutation must run on
  FINAL code — tests added here also kill mutants, so the score recorded at
  Ring 3 is the true one.

  > **Ring numbering is THIS project's**: 0 compile · 1 lint · 1.5 architecture ·
  > 2 property tests · 3 mutation · 4 formal · 5 cross-backend parity ·
  > 8 adversarial. It is NOT the upstream numbering some of these skills were
  > ported from, where 3 meant property tests and 5 meant mutation.
- Manually on any implemented spec.

## Fresh-Context Mandate

The review MUST be performed with NO implementation context: a fresh
session/subagent whose ONLY inputs are

1. the spec (every Requirement, Scenario, Property, Compile-Negative
   Obligation, Proof Obligation),
2. the approved typed contract, and
3. the implementation diff against the spec's Step 0 baseline SHA
   (`git diff <baseline-SHA>`).

Explicitly NOT an input: the conversation that produced the code. Self-review
by the author context is the confirmation-bias setup this ring exists to
defeat — the author knows what the code is "supposed" to do and reads that
intent into it. If a fresh context is genuinely impossible, say so in the
report: the checkpoint carries `fresh-context: no` and the human weighs the
verdicts accordingly.

## Procedure

### 1. Gather the evidence

- Read the spec: every Requirement, Scenario, Property, Compile-Negative
  Obligation, and Proof Obligation.
- Compute the implementation diff for this spec:
  `git diff <baseline-SHA>` (the baseline recorded at Step 0 — never the
  unanchored working tree, which after spec 1 contains other specs' changes).
- Read the diff COMPLETELY — including private helpers, companion objects,
  and default parameter values. Private helpers are where violations hide.

### 2. Requirement-by-requirement comparison

For EVERY requirement in the spec, locate the code that implements it and
answer in writing:

1. Does the code do what the English requirement says — in all branches,
   not just the tested ones?
2. Could the code pass the CURRENT tests while violating this requirement?
   (Weak generators, untested private helpers, untested direct-construction
   paths.) If yes, the requirement is at most PARTIAL.
3. Can a public API construct a state this requirement forbids? Try the
   direct construction path, not just the sanctioned pipeline (e.g.
   constructing an AST node directly instead of going through the
   typechecker). When a Metals MCP endpoint is available
   (openspec-code-intel skill), `metals-call.sh get-usages` on the guarded
   type enumerates every construction site authoritatively.
4. Are negative paths exercised directly, or only inferred?

### 3. Dangerous-pattern hunt

Run `openspec/schemas/verified-scala3/scanner/danger-scan.sh <baseline-SHA>`
(mechanical candidates), then judge each hit in the diff; every hit must be
justified (`// danger-scan:allow <reason>`) or fixed:

- fallback/default mappings (a function mapping an enum it shouldn't accept
  to some "harmless" value)
- `case _` in domain logic returning a VALID domain value for invalid input
- comments saying "unreachable", "cannot happen", "should never" without a
  type-level proof
- partial functions; `.get` on Option/Either/Try; unsafe `head`/`tail`/`last`
- unchecked casts, `asInstanceOf`, `@unchecked`
- swallowed errors (`case NonFatal(_) => ...` discarding the error,
  `.recover` to a default domain value)
- default parameter values that mask missing data

### 4. Oracle-tampering check

The oracle was approved at Step 2; verify it was not weakened since:

- no error assertion loosened to `.toString.contains(...)` / substring
  fallbacks where the spec names a structured variant
- no generator narrowed (added filter, tightened `Range`, dropped edge case)
  relative to the approved generator strategy declared in the spec

Any tampering found → the affected requirement is at most PARTIAL and the
oracle change needs human re-approval.

### 5. Verdict per requirement

```
Requirement-by-requirement review:
- Requirement A: PASS
- Requirement B: PARTIAL — public behavior passes; private helper
  cmpOpToCountOp maps IN to CountOp.Gte, violating the mapping contract
- Requirement C: FAIL — direct construction Expr.Count(..., CmpOp.IN, ...)
  produces wrong behavior; no type-level or runtime guard
```

For each PARTIAL/FAIL, state the fix class, strongest first:
1. type-level prevention (narrow the algebra, split the enum, GADT index)
2. smart constructor / explicit runtime rejection
3. new targeted test that would have caught it
Never "add a defensive fallback" — silent mapping to valid behavior is the
bug, not the fix.

### 6. Gate

- Any FAIL → fix it (re-running Rings 0–4 as affected) before proceeding to
  Ring 5.
- Any PARTIAL → fix it, or present it to the human for explicit approval at
  the checkpoint. The checkpoint summary MUST carry the verdict list.
- All PASS → record the report; proceed to Ring 5.
